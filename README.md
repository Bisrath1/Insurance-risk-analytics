# Final Report: Insurance Risk Analytics
## Task 1: Git and EDA
- Set up repository: `https://github.com/Bisrath1/Insurance-risk-analytics`.
- Performed EDA on `insurance.csv`, analyzed charges by region, sex, smoker.
## Task 2: DVC
- Versioned `insurance.csv` and `insurance_v2.csv` using DVC.
## Task 3: A/B Testing
- Tested hypotheses on charges by region and sex.
- Findings: [e.g., Significant differences in southeast region].
## Task 4: Modeling
- Built models for claim severity, premium, and claim probability.
- Best model: XGBoost (RMSE: X, R2: Y).
- SHAP: Smoker status and age most influential.
## Recommendations
- Adjust premiums for smokers and high-risk regions.
- Use claim probability model for risk-based pricing.
