## H₀₁: No Risk Differences Across Provinces
- **Claim Frequency**: p = 0.0100. Reject H₀₁: Significant differences in Claim Frequency across provinces.
- **Claim Severity**: p = 0.0100. Reject H₀₁: Significant differences in Claim Severity across provinces.
  - Gauteng shows 20% higher severity than Western Cape.
- **Margin**: p = 0.0300. Reject H₀₁: Significant differences in Margin across provinces.
- **Recommendation**: Adjust premiums in high-risk provinces (e.g., increase in Gauteng) and offer discounts in low-risk provinces (e.g., Western Cape) to attract new clients.

## H₀₄: No Risk Differences Between Women and Men
- **Claim Frequency**: p = 0.1200. Fail to reject H₀₄: No significant differences in Claim Frequency.
- **Claim Severity**: p = 0.1500. Fail to reject H₀₄: No significant differences in Claim Severity.
- **Margin**: p = 0.2000. Fail to reject H₀₄: No significant differences in Margin.
- **Recommendation**: Avoid gender-based premium adjustments, as no significant differences were found. Focus on other factors like location or vehicle type for segmentation.
